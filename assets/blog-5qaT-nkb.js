I’m using this blog to fill any gaps of information I want to share on this site that have no other place, and to document my journey of learning software development.","So to catch the Blog up on that journey, I guess it started with the weather. And smart home automation. After years of Google Home’s declining quality I stumbled upon Home Assistant (the tale as old as time). Despite having no experience with screen-less computers, for Christmas I requested a Raspberry Pi and a tutorial from my step-dad, and as soon as I returned from holiday travels, I was up and running.","At the same time, I was on month too-many of trying to decide what my next move was in my career. Sales was starting to wear on me, but working with Salesforce had started to inspire an interest in… “systems” is the best word I’ve ever had to describe it. Cleaning up data (and ours required a lot of cleaning) and learning how to use the tools to find and manipulate it was scratching a problem-solving itch I’ve always had (ever try logic puzzles?) in a brand new way.","I went through a good chunk of the free Trailhead courses on Salesforce Administration, and I was liking it, but was starting to get more interested in doing something with the data, which got me into Tableau. Tableau led me to the beginning of a Google Data Analytics Course, which was really helpful in realizing the kinds of problems data analysts are tackling take a long time and a lot of people to eventually be “solved”. I’m glad there are people out there doing that, but it was not sparking joy, as some might say.","Enter a common daily problem, which I’ve read is the best way to get started in coding, I hope it’s true. I live near the ocean, which is lovely, but makes the weather quite variable with the wind factor. Between that and the general level of inaccuracy of some of these weather services, the weather forecast I was getting in Home Assistant was not feeling right. Then I discovered WeatherUnderground, a GREAT source of hyper local weather data because it allows users to connect their Personal Weather Stations. It also allows broke users without PWS’s to view the weather data from nearby stations. This seems like a great solution, and to my delight it seemed Weatherunderground had an API I could use to connect to Home Assistant! But alas, I discovered that the precious API is only for PWS owners.","I started off googling, eventually got to chatGPT which pointed me toward web scraping. Initially I thought getting this data could make for a great data analysis project that could get me excited about that work again, so I let chatGPT write me some code to get the data scraping. But by the time I was done troubleshooting what the machine spit out to me enough to actually get everything working, I was hooked. I decided to go back to the beginning, and found myself learning the classic web trio, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.","From there I’ve continued to fall down a rabbit hole of languages to learn and projects to build and at the bottom realized I had enough interest to fuel a career. So that’s what I’m setting off to get now!","This first blog has turned out MUCH longer than I anticipated, so I’ll leave it there."]},{id:1,relativeDate:"Week 2",date:"May 31st",content:""},{id:2,relativeDate:"Week 3",date:"June 7th",content:""},{id:3,relativeDate:"Week 4",date:"June 14th",content:""},{id:4,relativeDate:"Week 5",date:"June 21st",content:""},{id:5,relativeDate:"Week 4",date:"June 14th",content:""}];function l(){const a=r.filter(t=>t.content!=="").map(t=>e.jsxs(e.Fragment,{children:[e.jsxs("h3",{children:["Blog Entry #",t.id+1," "]}),e.jsx("h4",{children:t.date}),t.content.map(o=>e.jsx("p",{children:o})),e.jsx("br",{})," ",e.jsxs("p",{children:["Until next time, ",e.jsx("br",{})," Fincorporated"]})]}));return e.jsx("div",{className:"blogEntryContainer",children:a})}function h(){return e.jsxs(e.Fragment,{children:[e.jsx("div",{className:"blogHeaderContainer",children:e.jsx(s,{})}),e.jsx(l,{})]})}n.createRoot(document.getElementById("root")).render(e.jsx(i.StrictMode,{children:e.jsx(h,{})}));
