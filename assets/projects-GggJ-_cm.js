If you aren’t familiar, the license plate game tasks players with the goal of spotting license plates from each of the 50 states (and in this case the 10 Canadian provinces) while on your journey. When I told my mom I was learning to code, this simple license plate tracker was her first demand request. It lets her avoid the ad-filled app versions and with local storage, she can keep the game going until she wants to reset it.",futureDevelopments:["Support for tracking multiple concurrent games (e.g., lifetime vs. individual trips)","Improved user interface and styling","Full rebuild as an iOS mobile app"]},{index:1,title:"Short or Long Sleeves?",image:"/sleeves.png",color:"#db3a34",link:"https://fincorporated.github.io/doINeedAJacket/",description:"In my house, this is an almost daily, often twice-a-day question, and one that we rarely answer adequately.
