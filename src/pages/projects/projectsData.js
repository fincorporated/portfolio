    title: 'License Plate Tracker',
    link: 'https://fincorporated.github.io/licensePlates/',
    description: "Growing up in my family, the second best game to play in the car (after the alphabet game) was the license plate game. If you aren’t familiar, the license plate game tasks players with the goal of spotting license plates from each of the 50 states (and in this case the 10 Canadian provinces) while on your journey. When I told my mom I was learning to code, this simple license plate tracker was her first demand request. It lets her avoid the ad-filled app versions and with local storage, she can keep the game going until she wants to reset it.",

    title: 'Do I Need A Jacket?',
    link: 'https://fincorporated.github.io/doINeedAJacket/',
    description: "In my house, this is an almost daily, often twice-a-day question, and one that we rarely answer adequately. This project is my work in progress solution to our what-to-where-weather-woes. Currently it can accept manually entered weather data (temperature and conditions) or a manually entered location (city and state) which it uses to fetch weather data through Open Meteo’s API, and based on that data, along with your personal temperature leanings it generates an answer to the question, do I need a jacket?",
    futureDevelopments: ['Geolocation in the browser', 'Custom API for integrating with Home Assistant (GET answer and/or POST weather)', 'Memory functionality through backend database, allowing users to save favorite locations and give feedback on outfit suggestions that will influence future suggestions, ie. if a user gives positive feedback on a recommendation made for a day that is 60°, sunny, with 5mph wind, then the next day with matching weather conditions will provide the same outfit recommendation.', 'More detailed outfit recommendations beyond outerwear, including the ability to save outfit preferences (such as sweaters vs. sweatshirts, types of jackets to recommend, etc.) and to exclude certain clothing items from recommendations.'],

    description: "Springboard to Design is a summer arts program for high school students to explore the design elements of theatre. I worked with the program's program manager to build a website that meets the current needs of the program; sharing information and resources, a call for donations, and a method of contacting the team.",
    futureDevelopments: ['Custom application form that accepts text-based responses as well as media uploads', 'Payment collection for donations', 'Contact form with inquiry categories (student, theatre professional, theatre educator, donor, etc.).'],

//     description: "Another request from my mother (what can I say? The woman raised me, I feel I owe her a couple basic websites). Though there are no shortage of habit tracking apps on the market, the most easily discovered are too busy with additional features for her, or they fail to provide the level of customization she needs to track her physical therapy exercises. The purpose of this tracker is to give users full control over the target frequency of a habit as well as additional trackable-variables. For example, my mom is looking to track reps of her exercises, which may be useful for many exercises, but if one wishes to track duration of their walks, or intensity of their workout on a scale of 1-10, or the title of the book they read, a custom variable allows them to do that.",
